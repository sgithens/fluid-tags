# Fluid Tags

This is a small utility to generate ctags output for Fluid style javascript
source. Eventually it may evolve into other utilities. At the moment it's geared
towards the output that gedit's source code browser requires.

# Usage

```shell
npm install
node fluid-tags.js stuff1 stuff2 stuff3 stuff4 yourfile.js 
# It's a long story, but you won't have to put the stuffs in eventually.
```
